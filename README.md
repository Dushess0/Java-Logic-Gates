# Java Logic Gates

I did it for the java lessons at my university.
Functions:
1) Define your logic operations (Click on "Mode" button add variables and complete the truth table
2) Uploading and downloading files from server ( it might me usefull for group of people but nobody will use this application)
3) Testing logic operations (may be someone use it to learn how they works)
